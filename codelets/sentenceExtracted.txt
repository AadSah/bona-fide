Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.
[26]Van Rossum led the language community until stepping down as leader in July 2018.
[27][28]Pythonfeatures a dynamic type system and automatic memory management.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional and procedural.
It also has a comprehensive standard library.
[29]Pythoninterpreters are available for many operating systems.
CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software[30] and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of Python's other implementations.
Python and CPython are managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.
