HI
I am Aadarsh
How are you
The foundation of the modern Bhubaneswar city was laid in 1948, although the areas in and around the city have a history going back to 1st century BCE or earlier
[9]

Dhauli, near Bhubaneswar was the site of the Kalinga War (c
262-261 BCE), in which the Mauryan emperor Ashoka invaded and annexed Kalinga
[9] One of the most complete edicts of the Mauryan Emperor, Ashoka, dating from between 272–236 BCE, remains carved in rock 8 kilometres (5
0 mi) to the southwest of the modern city
[10] After the decline of the Mauryan empire, the area came under the rule of Mahameghavahana dynasty, whose most well-known rule is Kharavela
His Hathigumpha inscription is located at the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar
The area was subsequently ruled by several dynasties, including Satavahanas, Guptas, Matharas, and Shailodbhavas
[9]

In 7th century, Somavamshi or Keshari dynasty established their kingdom in the area, and constructed a number of temples
After the Kesharis, the Eastern Gangas ruled Kalinga area until 14th century CE
Their capital Kalinganagara was located in present-day Bhubaneswar City
After them, Mukunda Deva of the Bhoi dynasty – the last Hindu ruler of the area until the Marathas – developed several religious buildings in the area
[9] Most of the older temples in Bhubaneswar were built between 8th and 12th centuries, under Shaiva influence
The Ananta Vasudeva Temple is the only old temple of Vishnu in the city
[11] In 1568, the Karrani dynasty of Afghan origin gained control of the area
During their reign, most of the temples and other structures were destroyed or disfigured
[9]

In the 16th century, the area came under pachamani Mughal control
The Marathas, who succeeded the Mughals in mid-18th century, encouraged pilgrimage in the region
In 1803, the area came under British colonial rule, and was part of the Bengal Presidency (until 1912), Bihar and Orissa Province (1912-1936) and Orissa Province (1936-1947)
[9] The capital of the British-ruled Orissa Province was Cuttack, which was vulnerabile to floods and suffered from space constraints
Because of this, on 30 September 1946, a proposal to move the capital to a new capital was introduced in the Legislative Assembly of the Orissa Province
After independence of India, the foundation of the new capital was laid by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on 13 April 1948
[9]

The name of the new capital came from "Tribhubaneswara" or "Bhubaneswara" (literally "Lord of the Earth"), a name of Shiva, the deity of the Lingaraja temple
[8] The Legislative Assembly of Orissa was shifted from Cuttack to Bhubaneswar in 1949
[9] Bhubaneswar was built as a modern city, designed by German architect Otto Königsberger with wide roads, gardens and parks
[12] Though part of the city followed the plan, it grew rapidly over the next few decades, outstripping the planning process
[13] According to the first census of independent India, taken in 1951, the city's population was just 16,512
From 1952 to 1979, it was administered by a Notified Area Council or a nagar panchayat; a municipality was established only on 12 March 1979
By the 1991 census, the population of Bhubaneswar had increased to 411,542
Accordingly, on 14 August 1994, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation was established
